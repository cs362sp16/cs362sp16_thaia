The percentage of code coverage for the first unit test was largest. It tapered
off significantly afterwards.

Reasons why this may be so:
* The first unit test covered the initializeGame function, which was pretty
  big, while the others tested were much smaller
* My tests were not as thorough after the first one (which is true for some...)

After running through the game (via running playdom), I got around 50%
coverage on the dominion code. To be honest, this value doesn't seem accurate.
I feel like I may have missed some things in my tests, but we'll see.

As for unit testing itself, I found it a bit strange to do in C. I found myself
writing tests for the wrong things, but after falling into a groove, it came
along much easier, as with all things.

The card tests were simpler to test than the game functions, because they
could be written in a sort of format. Whereas the game functions varied quite a
bit (in what you should test for).
