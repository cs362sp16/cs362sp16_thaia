The unit test for the card ``steward`` fails.

The resulting error message when printing coverage results was:
```
  ...

  coins b: 5
  FAILED ASSERTION: Add 2 coins
  
  coins a: 5
  FAILED ASSERTION: Trash 2 cards
  
  GCOV AFTER 7 TESTS
  Testing: cardtest3.c
  File 'dominion.c'
  Lines executed:36.67% of 559
  Creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

  ...

```

From this, it can be gleaned that what's causing ``steward`` to fail the unit
test has to do with updating coins and discarding from the hand.
