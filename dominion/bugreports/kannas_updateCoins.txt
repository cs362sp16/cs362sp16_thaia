The unit test for the function ``updateCoins`` within dominion.c fails.

The resulting error message when printing coverage results was:
```
  ...

  FAILED ASSERTION: Correct phase
  
  GCOV AFTER 2 TESTS

```

This seems to suggest that in the function updateCoins, game phase is not being
changed (correctly). This causes everything afterwards to fail.
