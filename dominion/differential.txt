The games ended up being very different, so it's hard to say whose
implementation of dominion was correct.

The tester isn't perfect in how it randomizes a lot of the moves so sometimes
it stalls... which is unfortunate. I also accidentally overwrote my dominion.c
at one point (git reverted though!)...

Alongside that, the way that the info is displayed is hard to parse through.
So even if things were ideal, mistakes can still be made because the diff
output is difficult to interpret/understand.

Note: For testdominion_second.out, the gcov results are ~69%. I actually ran
the tester twice to get that amount of coverage. However, I forget to append
the first gcov results to the end of the file. On the first run-through, there
should also be:

  File 'dominion.c'
  Lines executed:55.73% of 558
  Creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

Edit: .out files were recently updated, so the above comment doesn't apply
anymore (but I'll leave in case you want to grade a previous commit).
