The Tarantula Process:

Files used to caculate "suspiciousness" were:
* Makefile
* randomtestadventurer.c and randomtestadventurer.out
* randomtestcard1.c and randomtestcard1.out
* randomtestcard2.c and randomtestcard2.out
* The corresponsing dominion.c.gov files for each test run

The process for me was long and frustrating for two (main) reasons.
  1) I realized a little too late that I was parsing unittest files
  2) Several files needed to be reworked to provide more information
     to supplement my script

How I found the values of failed(e), passed(e), totalfailed, and totalpassed
for each of the random tests:

  The process started with parsing the .out files for each of the cards.
  I randomly generated how many times the tests would run and kept a counter.
  During the runs, every time a series of assertions failed, an error message
  would be printed. When all the tests finished running, I parsed the files and
  incremented a counter every time I found an instance of "FAILURE" in the
  file.

  From there, I just subtracted the amount of failures from the number
  of tests run for each card to find out how many passed. The same process was
  repeated for each of the other cards to calculate the suspiciousness values.

  Results were:
    * 1 for randomtestcard1.c which tested ``cutpurse`` -- and subsequently
      broke every time on updateCoins)

    * 0 for randomtestcard2.c which tested ``smithy``, the simplest function

    * 0.0738 for randomtestadventurer.c -- for this card, there was rare
      failure in which the used card would never be put into the discard pile

The final output is as shown below:
```
  FILE OPENED:  rtresults/randomtestadventurer.out
  Total tests run for adventurer:  664
  Passing tests:  652
  Number of failures in ``adventurer``:  12 
  
  FILE OPENED:  rtresults/randomtestcard1.out
  Total tests run for cutpurse:  314
  Passing tests:  0
  Number of failures in ``cutpurse``:  314 
  
  FILE OPENED:  rtresults/randomtestcard2.out
  Total tests run for smithy:  760
  Passing tests:  760
  Number of failures in ``smithy``:  0
  
  Total passed:  1412
  Total failed:  326
  
  suspicious adventurer:  0.0738313521804
  suspicious cutpurse:  1.0
  suspicious smithy:  0.0
