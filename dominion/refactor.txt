Cards refactored out of the hellishly long switch statement:
* council_room
* remodel
* minion 
* steward
* cutpurse

The following functions start on line 646:
* int play_council_room(struct gameState *state, int handPos);
* int play_remodel(int choice1, int choice2, struct gameState *state,
                   int handPos);
* int play_minion(int choice1, int choice2, struct gameState *state,
                  int handPos);
* int play_steward(int choice1, int choice2, int choice3,
                   struct gameState *state, int handPos);
* int cutpurse(struct gameState *state, int handPos);

Refactoring/extraction process:
  Picked 5 cards depending on their case length and complexity.

  Afterwards, all I did was create the appropriate function (placed above
  cardEffect) and yanked the relevant code from its place in the switch
  statement. After commenting out that card's case in the switch statement, I
  pasted the [card's] code into its corresponding function and 
  reformatted the spacing. The function parameters were identified and placed
  accordingly; same with variables that needed to be declared.

  After refactoring each function, the code was recompiled and run through
  with ``./playdom (num) (num)`` to check that it wouldn't seg fault. Once
  everything checked out, the duplicate code left in the switch statement was
  removed.
