There seems to be bugs in play_steward.

One of them makes sense - it was a bug I added in which one of the discardCard
functions was commented out, so cards aren't trashed correctly.

However, it doesn't seem like coins are being added correctly when the user
selects choice1 == 2. I'm uncertain if this is because my assert is checking
for the wrong thing.

There also might be a bug in the cut_purse card.
